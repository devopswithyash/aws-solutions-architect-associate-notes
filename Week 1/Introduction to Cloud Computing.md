## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of services like servers, storage, databases, software, and more over the internet. It allows faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

**Traditional IT vs Cloud Computing**

| Traditional IT                        | Cloud Computing                      |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Buy hardware upfront                 | Rent on-demand                       |
| Maintain data centers                | Use managed cloud infrastructure     |
| Predict capacity years ahead         | Instantly scale up/down              |
| Pay for peak capacity                | Pay for what you use                 |

## Essential Characteristics

Defined by [NIST](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf):

- **On-demand self-service**: No human interaction needed.
- **Broad network access**: Available from anywhere.
- **Resource pooling**: Multi-tenant model.
- **Rapid elasticity**: Instantly scalable.
- **Measured service**: Metered usage, pay-as-you-go.

## Cloud Service Models

### Pizza Analogy

| Model         | You Manage                        | Provider Manages                  | AWS Examples         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Traditional IT| Everything                        | Nothing                           | On-premise            |
| IaaS          | OS, middleware, apps              | Hardware, network                 | EC2, EBS, VPC         |
| PaaS          | Apps and data                     | Platform and infra                | Elastic Beanstalk, RDS|
| SaaS          | Just use the app                  | Everything                        | Amazon Chime, WorkMail|

## Cloud Deployment Models

| Model         | Description                        | Examples              | Pros                           | Cons                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Public Cloud  | Third-party provider, shared infra | AWS, Azure, GCP       | Scalable, cost-effective       | Less control            |
| Private Cloud | Dedicated to one org               | VMware, OpenStack     | High control and privacy       | Costly, less scalable   |
| Hybrid Cloud  | Mix of public & private            | AWS Outposts, Azure Arc| Flexibility, sensitive data    | Complex integration     |
| Multi-cloud   | Multiple providers in use          | AWS + GCP + Azure     | Avoid lock-in, best of each    | Increased complexity    |

## Fun Cloud Facts

- AWS‚Äôs first service was **SQS**, not EC2.
- AWS Graviton chips are custom Arm processors.
- If AWS were a company, it would be in the **Fortune 100**.
- The term *cloud computing* has been around since the 1990s.

## Hands-on Exercise

> Try this to make the concept real:

1. Think of a cloud-based app you use (e.g., Gmail, Notion).
2. Identify its service model: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS?
3. Which deployment model applies: Public, Private, Hybrid?
4. List 3 benefits you experience from it.
